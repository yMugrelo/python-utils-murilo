# Hi there, I'm Murilo Rosa 

# Python Utils — Murilo Rosa

Welcome to my personal Python utilities repository!

This is a **learning-focused workspace** where I experiment with Python concepts, tools, and scripts — from basic automation and file handling to API integration, data manipulation, and web scraping.

> ⚠ This is **not** a production-level repository. It's a sandbox for learning, prototyping, and testing.

##  What you'll find here

-  Practical scripts for automation
-  File and folder management utilities
-  API request/response handling
-  Web scraping experiments
-  Reusable helper functions
-  Notes and exercises from **courses and books**
-  Jupyter Notebooks for testing and exploration
